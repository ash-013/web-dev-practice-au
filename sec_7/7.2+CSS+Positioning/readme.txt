-> Static Positioning (HTML Default):
    The default position of HTML

-> Relative Positioning (Relative to it's supposed location):
    Position relative to default position, relative position takes the default positioning and then we can move it relatively.

-> Absolute Positioning:
    Positoin relative to the nearest positioned ancestor or top left corner of the webpage, if the ancestor is not present.

-> Fixed Position:
    Position relative to top left corner of the browser window

-> z-index: (0 by default):
    to move the item move behind/front, (in absolute position, it actually takes the element out of original html flow and puts it on another layer)

     0: default, take it above
    -1: goes behind
